STOP - NDA Required

This project contains proprietary code under NDAs with game console 
manufacturers. 

You can only use this code if you:
- Have signed the required umbrella NDAs
- Are currently enrolled in the CMGT program at BUAS
- Have been given explicit access by the instructor

================================================================================

What You Can Do

- Use this code for your coursework and projects
- Work with it in your assigned groups
- Study and learn from it
- Modify it for your assignments
- Compile and run it on authorized hardware
- Contribute to the development of the software


What You Cannot Do

- Post it online (GitHub, forums, Discord, anywhere)
- Give it to students (or future students) not enrolled this semester
- Break your console manufacturer NDAs (they still apply to everything here)


Your NDA Obligations Still Apply

Everything under NDA from the console makers stays confidential. Handle this 
code like any other NDA material - carefully and privately.


No Warranty

This code is provided "as is" - no guarantees it works perfectly, no 
liability for issues.


If You Break These Rules

Your access gets revoked immediately if you:
- Share outside the course
- Break your NDAs
- Violate academic integrity policies

You could also face academic penalties and legal consequences.
